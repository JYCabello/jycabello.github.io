        <title>Plunder with thunder</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I work in an industry where knowledge is, most of the time, valued over diplomas and certifications, so it has been relatively
easy to thrive without a degree.
That does not mean that I haven’t received my fair share of “you have to be an actual engineer” and “I don’t think you are qualified to do that”.
I did have the option to finish my computer science studies, but as I was already working in the industry I found myself with less and less time
to study and had to make a decision. I ended up quitting my studies to… have time to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

trip around the nature of the blog.&lt;/p&gt;
